/** 
  * \defgroup IterativeLinearSolvers_Module IterativeLinearSolvers module
  *
  * This module currently provides iterative methods to solve problems of the form \c A \c x = \c b, where \c A is a squared matrix, usually very large and sparse.
  * Those solvers are accessible via the following classes:
  *  - ConjugateGradient for selfadjoint (hermitian) matrices,
  *  - LeastSquaresConjugateGradient for rectangular least-square problems,
  *  - BiCGSTAB for general square matrices.
  *
  * These iterative solvers are associated with some preconditioners:
  *  - IdentityPreconditioner - not really useful
  *  - DiagonalPreconditioner - also called Jacobi preconditioner, work very well on diagonal dominant matrices.
  *  - IncompleteLUT - incomplete LU factorization with dual thresholding
  *
  * Such problems can also be solved using the direct sparse decomposition modules: SparseCholesky, CholmodSupport, UmfPackSupport, SuperLUSupport.
  *
